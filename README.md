# Spark for Kotlin

## Introduction

Basic template for RESTful web apps using Spark, JDBC, JOOQ, Flyway, and Kotlin.

* Spark offers a beautiful DSL for writing web apps
* JDBC for database connection, H2 used as an example
* JOOQ, because writing SQL by hand is error prone
* Flyway for database migrations
* Kotlin, because this project is all about learning Kotlin, after all

This project template was born out of the frustration towards complex and heavyweight web app frameworks that are hard to learn and have long compile-run-test turnaround times. Effort will be put into picking frameworks that are known to perform well in production use. Performance and scalability are key drivers when putting stuff together. 

The template is still in its early infancy, so keep an eye out for updates. It might be rolled into a framework of its own later on.
